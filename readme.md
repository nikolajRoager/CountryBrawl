Country Brawl
=============
THIS PROJECT IS ACTIVELY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT IT WORKS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

The project description here is also very incomplete.

What is this
------
It is a game, which I am trying to develop in 128 days or less, which is a bit of an ambitious goal, but interesting nevertheless.

In particular, it is an RTS (Real Time Strategy) game about 56 countries trying to conquer Europe

How Do I play the game?
-----------
For now, while the game is actively under development, there is no option to download the game Executable.

You will need to compile the game from the source code.

The easiest way to do that is to install the [CLion IDE from Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), which is the one I use, and which I know work.
Just clone this project in CLion (google how to do that if you don't know) and hit run... And maybe, just maybe, it will work, but honestly I can't guarantee that.

I don't know if it is possible to build and run using Microsoft Visual Studio (And I am not going to test that), but feel free to try
